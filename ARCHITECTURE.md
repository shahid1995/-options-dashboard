# StrikeNova — Architecture

> **Purpose:** Living architectural map of the current StrikeNova system.
>
> **Status:** Active
>
> **Primary question answered here:** How do the major parts of StrikeNova relate to one another, where are the boundaries, and where does authoritative state live?
>
> This document describes the current architecture. It is not a backlog, implementation plan, or historical phase ledger.

## 1. System overview

StrikeNova is a full-stack options-intelligence and paper-trading application with four major technical boundaries:

```text

                                             authentication flow
```

The most important architectural rule is the separation of responsibilities:

- **Frontend:** interaction, presentation, local UI state, previews, client-side display calculations.
- **Backend:** authenticated API boundary, business rules, broker access, authoritative paper execution, persistence, server-side analytics and validation.
- **Broker layer:** provider-specific market/auth connectivity behind a common domain boundary.
- **Database:** durable application state and analytical/history state, with Alembic controlling schema evolution.

---

## 2. Repository boundary

The repository root is:

```text
/
├── PROJECT-CONTROL.md
├── AI.md
├── AGENTS.md
├── CONTEXT.md
├── INVARIANTS.md
├── DECISIONS.md
├── .github/
└── options-dashboard-project/
```

The application source lives under:

```text
options-dashboard-project/
end{verbatim}
```

Primary runtime areas:

```text
options-dashboard-project/
├── frontend/
├── backend/
├── docs/
└── .github/
```

The `docs/` tree contains historical engineering records, audits, specifications, plans, and acceptance evidence. Those records are useful architectural evidence but do not automatically override the active root control documents.

---

## 3. Frontend architecture

### 3.1 Stack

Current frontend stack:

- Next.js 14.2.35
- React 18.3.1
- React DOM 18.3.1
- JavaScript / JSX
- Axios 1.19.0
- Recharts 2.12.7
- Vitest 4.1.10
- V8 coverage through `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4.1.10
- Google OAuth client package where applicable

The frontend uses the Next.js App Router.

### 3.2 Route structure

The frontend is divided into intentional route groups:

```text
frontend/app/
├── (public)/
└── (app)/
```

The public route group contains the public StrikeNova website, including:

- `/`
- `/features`
- `/market-intelligence`
- `/strategy-lab`
- `/paper-trading`
- `/how-it-works`
- `/about`

The authenticated application group contains product areas such as:

- dashboard;
- activity;
- brokers;
- gex;
- market;
- orders;
- paper;
- portfolio;
- positions;
- settings;
- strategies.

The route-group separation is architectural: public presentation and authenticated product behavior are related, but not the same application boundary.

### 3.3 Frontend responsibilities

The frontend is responsible for:

- rendering product workflows;
- accepting user input;
- calling backend APIs;
- displaying backend state;
- presenting market/option-chain information;
- displaying GEX and portfolio analytics;
- managing user-facing previews and interaction state;
- providing public-site visual and navigation experiences.

The frontend is **not** authoritative for:

- authenticated ownership;
- broker authorization;
- fill price;
- paper order acceptance;
- positions;
- cash;
- realized P&L;
- execution success;
- database schema.

### 3.4 Frontend shared/domain layer

`frontend/lib/` contains reusable application/domain utilities and calculations, including:

- market status;
- option/pricing utilities;
- paper/portfolio utilities;
- strategy utilities;
- session/auth helpers;
- chain-feed hooks;
- GEX capture/persistence helpers;
- UI primitives/tokens.

`frontend/components/` contains reusable feature and domain components, including the GEX visualization/panel family.

The existence of a frontend calculation does not make that calculation the backend system of record. When the same concept exists on both sides, the authoritative role must remain explicit.

---

## 4. Backend architecture

### 4.1 Stack

Current backend stack:

- Python 3.13 runtime
- FastAPI 0.141.1
- Uvicorn
- httpx
- Pydantic Settings
- SQLAlchemy 2.0.43
- Alembic 1.15.2
- cryptography
- PyJWT

Primary entry point:

```text
backend/app/main.py
```

### 4.2 Backend layers

The backend can be understood as these layers:

```text
HTTP / FastAPI Routers
        │
        ▼
Authentication / Authorization Dependencies
        │
        ▼
Domain & Application Services
        │
        ├───────────────▶ Broker Gateway / Adapters
        │
        └───────────────▶ SQLAlchemy Persistence
                              │
                              ▼
                         PostgreSQL / SQLite
```

The router layer should coordinate HTTP concerns, validation, authentication dependencies, and service invocation.

Domain rules should live in reusable backend services rather than being duplicated across routers.

### 4.3 Router responsibilities

The repository contains router modules for major domains such as:

- authentication;
- option chains;
- paper trading;
- templates;
- GEX snapshots;
- live GEX;
- historical GEX;
- candles;
- resolution/selection;
- annotations.

Important mounting fact:

The current `main.py` registration must be treated as the source of truth for what is externally mounted. The existence of a router module in the repository does not by itself mean that every endpoint is currently exposed.

### 4.4 Authentication and identity

The identity architecture separates:

```text
StrikeNova User
      │
      ├── UserSession
      │
      └── BrokerConnection
              │
              └── BrokerToken / credential state
```

The canonical application identity is the StrikeNova `User`.

A broker connection is a user-owned relationship, not the user's platform identity.

Authentication dependencies resolve the current identity before protected resources are accessed.

---

## 5. Broker integration architecture

Broker integration is intentionally layered:

```text
Application service
       │
       ▼
Broker Gateway
       │
       ▼
Broker Registry
       │
       ▼
Broker Adapter
       │
       ▼
Provider API
```

Current provider implementation includes Upstox under:

```text
backend/app/brokers/adapters/upstox/
```

The broker domain contains:

- capabilities;
- enums;
- errors;
- models;
- protocols.

### 5.1 Why the boundary exists

Broker APIs differ in:

- authentication flows;
- token lifetimes;
- request formats;
- capabilities;
- error semantics;
- account/profile representations.

Provider-specific behavior therefore belongs behind the adapter boundary.

Business services should depend on broker capabilities and stable domain contracts rather than spreading provider-specific conditions throughout the application.

### 5.2 BYOB ownership

The broker layer follows the active BYOB architecture:

- customer broker credentials belong to the corresponding StrikeNova user;
- broker connections are user-scoped;
- tokens/credentials are treated as secrets;
- the system must not silently switch users or connections;
- explicit connection selection is required where ambiguity would matter.

---

## 6. Paper-trading architecture

Paper trading has a deliberate authoritative domain model.

### 6.1 Core state flow

```text
User intent
    │
    ▼
HTTP / Paper Router
    │
    ▼
Execution Intent / Validation
    │
    ▼
Market Gate + Market Data Resolution
    │
    ▼
Authoritative Paper Execution
    │
    ├── StrategyExecution
    ├── PaperOrder
    ├── Position
    ├── PaperTransaction
    ├── StrategyLegExposure
    └── Journal linkage
```

The backend is authoritative for:

- accepted/rejected execution;
- authoritative market price;
- filled quantity;
- order state;
- position state;
- cash movement;
- realized P&L;
- execution/journal reconciliation.

### 6.2 Entry and exit

Entry operations include manual/strategy/template-driven paper execution.

Exit operations include:

- position exits;
- trade-leg closing;
- bulk exits;
- strategy-aware exits.

All state-changing execution paths must preserve the same fundamental protections rather than introducing a second execution implementation.

### 6.3 Idempotency

`client_order_id` is used as an idempotency boundary.

The purpose is to make retries safe against:

- duplicate clicks;
- network retries;
- ambiguous responses;
- client reconnects.

Idempotency must be:

- server enforced;
- user scoped;
- backed by persistence/constraints;
- preserved across entry and exit flows.

### 6.4 Market gate

Paper execution must pass an execution-time server-side market-status check.

The frontend may display market status, but the backend determines whether the execution is permitted.

Unknown market state is not treated as open.

---

## 7. Database architecture

### 7.1 Database technology

The application uses SQLAlchemy ORM with:

- SQLite for local/default operation;
- PostgreSQL when `DATABASE_URL` is configured.

SQLite is configured with WAL behavior for local resilience.

PostgreSQL uses connection pooling and health-oriented connection settings.

### 7.2 Schema authority

Alembic is the authoritative production schema mechanism.

Startup uses the versioned migration path:

```text
Application startup
      │
      ▼
Alembic upgrade head
      │
      ▼
Idempotent data backfill / startup maintenance
      │
      ▼
Application ready
```

The production architecture must not fall back to ORM `create_all()` or runtime column mutation as the schema authority.

### 7.3 Principal data domains

The database can be understood as several domains.

#### Identity

- `users`
- `user_sessions`
- `broker_connections`
- `broker_tokens`

#### Paper trading

- `paper_accounts`
- `strategy_executions`
- `paper_orders`
- `positions`
- `paper_transactions`
- `strategy_leg_exposures`
- `exit_exposure_allocations`
- `bulk_exit_records`

#### Journal / strategy compatibility

- `trades`
- `legs`
- `strategy_templates`
- `strategy_template_legs`

#### Market data

- `nifty_candles`
- `contract_specs`
- `option_candles`
- `option_greeks`

#### Analytics / research

- `gex_snapshots`
- `historical_gex`
- `iv_observations`

#### Ingestion infrastructure

- `ingestion_log`
- `data_completeness`
- `ingestion_checkpoint`

### 7.4 Ownership

User-owned records must remain user-scoped.

Shared market/reference data may be shared where intentionally designed, but ownership must never be inferred from the table name alone.

---

## 8. Market-data and quant architecture

The market-data side of the system distinguishes source data from derived analytics.

A simplified pipeline is:

```text
Broker / upstream market data
           │
           ▼
     Raw / reference data
           │
           ▼
      Derived models
       (e.g. Greeks)
           │
           ▼
       Analytics
   (GEX / exposures / research)
           │
           ▼
    Frontend visualizations
```

This separation is important because:

- raw data has different provenance from derived calculations;
- derived models can be recomputed;
- analytical contracts may have methodology/version requirements;
- historical research must be traceable to source assumptions.

---

## 9. GEX architecture

GEX exists as a cross-cutting analytics domain.

Relevant backend components include:

- GEX routers;
- `LiveGexService`;
- GEX history/persistence services;
- GEX capture;
- GEX data-quality analysis;
- historical GEX services.

The current raw GEX convention is:

```text
raw_gex = gamma × open_interest × spot² × 0.01
```

The repository convention does not add a lot-size multiplier to this raw calculation.

Signed GEX uses the established call/put sign convention.

### 9.1 GEX persistence ownership

Authenticated GEX snapshots are user-scoped.

Background capture also requires explicit user/connection authorization and must not silently select an arbitrary user's broker connection.

### 9.2 Historical GEX

Historical GEX is an operationally controlled feature.

The repository exposes explicit configuration controls for history/capture behavior. Historical collection is not assumed to be globally active merely because the service exists.

---

## 10. Historical-data architecture

Historical data has a separate operational lifecycle from request-time product behavior.

The broader flow is:

```text
Upstream historical API
        │
        ▼
Backfill / ingestion
        │
        ├── checkpoints
        ├── rate control
        ├── ingestion logs
        └── completeness checks
        │
        ▼
Persisted historical market data
        │
        ▼
Derived Greeks
        │
        ▼
Historical GEX / research analytics
```

Important architectural properties:

- ingestion is checkpointable;
- rate limiting and upstream failure are explicit concerns;
- source limitations must remain visible;
- derived analytics must not overwrite raw source records;
- historical collection must remain bounded by configuration and retention policy.

---

## 11. Background processing

The web application contains controlled background behavior, including the optional GEX capture loop.

Background work must:

- have explicit enablement;
- use user-owned authorization;
- close database sessions reliably;
- tolerate individual failures;
- apply bounded retry/backoff where implemented;
- stop cleanly during application shutdown;
- avoid creating hidden global mutable state.

Long-running ingestion/backfill workflows also exist as operational tooling rather than being treated as ordinary HTTP request handlers.

---

## 12. Configuration architecture

Backend configuration is centralized through the application settings layer.

Configuration controls include:

- database connection;
- broker/application credentials;
- historical-data feature flags;
- GEX capture/history behavior;
- candle interval/retention;
- frontend origin / API origin integration.

Feature flags that govern expensive or historical collection must default to the safe/non-collecting state unless explicitly enabled.

Secrets belong in environment/configuration infrastructure, never source-controlled documentation.

---

## 13. Runtime and deployment architecture

The repository's intended runtime topology is:

```text
GitHub
  │
  ├──────────────▶ Vercel
  │                 └── Next.js frontend
  │
  └──────────────▶ Railway
                    └── FastAPI backend
                         └── PostgreSQL when DATABASE_URL is configured
```

The public website and authenticated application have separate frontend/deployment concerns within the product architecture.

Deployment is operationally controlled and must not be inferred from code changes alone.

---

## 14. Verification architecture

The project uses multiple verification layers:

```text
Unit / domain tests
        ↓
API / integration tests
        ↓
Security / ownership / migration tests
        ↓
Frontend test suite
        ↓
Next.js production build
        ↓
Browser/runtime verification where applicable
        ↓
CI
```

Backend verification should cover domain correctness, persistence, security boundaries, concurrency, and migration behavior.

Frontend verification should cover component behavior, application behavior, route/runtime behavior, accessibility where applicable, and production build integrity.

A green unit suite does not by itself prove browser/runtime correctness, deployment correctness, or security isolation.

---

## 15. Architectural boundaries that should not be crossed casually

### Frontend → Backend

Do not move authoritative business state into browser-only storage for convenience.

### Backend → Broker

Do not bypass the broker gateway/adapter boundary with direct provider calls from unrelated business modules.

### Router → Database

Do not duplicate domain state transitions directly in many routers. Use the established service/domain path.

### ORM → Schema

Do not treat model definitions as a substitute for Alembic migration history.

### Historical docs → Current architecture

Do not treat an old phase plan or audit as automatically current.

### User → Broker identity

Do not equate broker account identity with the StrikeNova platform user.

### Quant formula → UI convenience

Do not alter a persisted analytical methodology merely to simplify frontend presentation.

---

## 16. Common architectural change patterns

### Adding a feature

Prefer:

```text
Issue
  ↓
Boundary identification
  ↓
Service/domain change
  ↓
API contract
  ↓
Frontend integration
  ↓

```

### Adding a broker

Prefer:

```text

Provider adapter
        ↓
Registry / gateway
        ↓
Service integration
        ↓
User-owned connection
        ↓
Verification
```

Do not spread provider-specific conditionals through the application.

### Changing database structure

Prefer:

```text
Schema design
  ↓
Alembic migration
  ↓
Data compatibility analysis
  ↓
Application model/service updates
  ↓
Migration tests
  ↓
Runtime verification
```

### Changing a quant methodology

Prefer:

```text
Research / evidence
  ↓
Decision record
  ↓
Methodology version/change contract
  ↓
Implementation
  ↓
Historical compatibility analysis
  ↓
Tests + analytics verification
```

## 17. Source-of-truth map

| Question | Primary authority |
|---|---|
| What is the current implementation? | Repository code |
| What work is active? | GitHub issues / project workflow |
| How must an agent operate? | `AGENTS.md` |
| Where should an agent start reading? | `AI.md` |
| What is the current system map? | `CONTEXT.md` |
| What architecture is currently intended? | `ARCHITECTURE.md` + active `DECISIONS.md` |
| What must not be broken? | `INVARIANTS.md` |
| Why was a major decision made? | `DECISIONS.md` |
| What happened historically? | `options-dashboard-project/docs/` |
| What is the project workflow? | `PROJECT-CONTROL.md` |

When these sources appear inconsistent, inspect the current code and active control documents before acting.

---

## 18. Architecture-change rule

Architecture may evolve. The goal is not to freeze implementation details.

The requirement is to preserve intentional boundaries and make material changes explicit.

When a change affects an architectural invariant or active decision:

1. identify the affected boundary;
2. record the proposed change;
3. update the relevant decision/invariant documentation;
4. implement the change in a scoped issue;
5. verify the integrated behavior;
6. update this architecture map when the topology actually changes.

The architecture document should describe the system that exists, not an imagined future system.

---

## 19. Architectural principle

StrikeNova should remain understandable as the system grows:

**Clear boundaries, authoritative state, explicit ownership, controlled change, and evidence-backed verification.**

The architecture is successful when a future developer or AI agent can determine:

- where a behavior belongs;
- which layer owns the truth;
- which boundary must not be bypassed;
- which decision governs the change;
- and how to verify that the change preserved the system.
