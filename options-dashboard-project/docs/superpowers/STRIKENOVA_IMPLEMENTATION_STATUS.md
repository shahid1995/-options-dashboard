## Phase 0 — Security Emergency

### Day 1 — Repository Secret Containment

**Status:** PASS

| Item | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Tracked `.env.local` removed | Commit `4879537` — `chore(security): contain tracked environment files` |
| `.gitignore` hardened | `.env.*`, `!.env.example`, `*.db*`, `.token_cache/`, `upstox_token.json` all ignored |
| Gitleaks CI workflow added | Commit `454f381` — `ci(security): add automated secret scanning` |
| Git-history secret scan | 314 commits scanned, 0 real secrets, 18 false positives (test fixtures) |
| `.env.example` placeholders only | Verified: 4 placeholder values, no real credentials |
| No token caches tracked | Verified: `git ls-files` returns nothing |
| No SQLite DBs tracked | Verified |
| Production untouched | Confirmed |

### Day 2 — Security Baseline and Dependency Hygiene

**Status:** PASS

| Item | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Security tests (248/248) | Auth, crypto, BYOB, session separation, platform-session, identity, CORS, Google auth, broker profile |
| Frontend tests (1453/1453) | 61 test files pass |
| Frontend build | PASS (19 routes) |
| No secrets in logs/responses | Verified by crypto/serialization test coverage |

### Day 3 — Tenant and Credential Safety Review

**Status:** PASS

| Item | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| OAuth identity binding | Commit `40fdbf3` — `/auth/login` requires authenticated session (401 without), callback requires bound session |
| Platform credential fallback removal | `settings.UPSTOX_API_KEY` no longer used as fallback in BYOB OAuth path |
| OAuth state security | HMAC-signed, single-use, session-bound; legacy unsigned states rejected |
| Callback broker override prevention | Broker comes from signed state only, query param ignored |
| Callback session-mismatch rejection | Empty/expired/wrong-session state rejected with 400 |
| Cross-user OAuth state isolation | 19 Day 3 security tests pass including cross-user state reuse/replay |
| Credential encryption at rest | Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) via `app.crypto.encrypt/decrypt` |
| Credential serialization isolation | Never in responses, logs, or error messages — verified by tests |
| Broker/platform separation | Platform session never confused with broker token — verified by existing + Day 3 tests |
| Logout/revocation idempotency | Idempotent (200 for valid/expired/fake/no session) — verified by tests |
| UpstoxTokenManager file persistence | Removed from OAuth callback (Day 3 hardening) |
| Day 3 security tests | 19/19 pass — `tests/test_day3_security.py` |
| Auth/BYOB/security tests | 312/312 pass |
| Frontend tests | 1453/1453 pass |
| Frontend build | PASS |
| Production untouched | Confirmed — no DATABASE_URL, Railway, or Vercel changes |
| Commit SHA | `40fdbf3` |
